# Demographic-Analysis

For reading the dataset, we recommend placing the '.csv' file (from Kaggle) within a `data` folder inside the `resources` folder. 

## Problem Statement
The study conducts an analysis of a sample of
the population with the help of Big Data technolo-
gies in the demographics realm. This demographic
analysis explores a dataset of deceased famous in-
dividuals, extracted from Wikipedia containing in-
formation regarding the work, age, and death of in-
dividuals. 
## Analysis and PySpark
The
analysis was conducted using PySpark, a powerful
distributed computing framework for large-scale
data, followed by a few preprocessing steps, and
then performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
was conducted to gain insights and distribution of
various predictors within the dataset.
